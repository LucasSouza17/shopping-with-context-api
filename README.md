# Shopping-cart with Context-API

## Learning

This project was done as a test to enter a company.
In it I learned more deeply how the Context API works in practice

## Technologies

 - React Native
 - Expo
 - Javascript
 - React Hooks
 - Typescript
 - Context-API

## Getting Started

First, install all dependencies

``` bash

npm install

# or

yarn install

```

## Attention

This project does not go with the api, however it is very simple to create your own, follow the example.

* Create a document of the name you prefer
* Then paste this code into it and add the data as you wish

``` bash
{
  "products": [
		{
			 "id": Number,
			 "title": String,
			 "price": Number,
			 "numbers": [
			      Number, Number, Number
			    ],
			 "description": String,
			 "imagelink": String,
			 "stock": Number,
			 "count": Number
		}
			]
}

```

  + Then access this repository and learn more about the json-server, it's very simple
